langtonant
==========

![screenshot](https://github.com/jessehorne/ant/blob/master/screenshot.png)

An open-source implementation of Langton's Ant using Python and pygame.

## Please Note!
This is a slightly modified version of Langton's Ant. The difference is that the ant is confined to a "box" (the screen). This causes different behavior than the infinite "highway" that you would normally see.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* pygame 1.9.1

## Running
```
python ant.py
```

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)
